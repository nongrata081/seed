# seed

Purpose of this repo is to serve as a seed repository for any kind of project, that has some
basic functionality:

# Commit linting
Checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format. Note: Please check [rules](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/blob/master/docs/reference-rules.md) / [rules](https://conventional-changelog.github.io/commitlint/#/reference-rules)  before using it.

In general the pattern mostly looks like this:

`type(scope?): subject` (scope is optional)

Real world examples can look like this:

`chore: run tests on travis ci`

`fix(server): send cors headers`

`feat(blog): add comment section`

---

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) (based on the the Angular convention) can be:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

These can be modified by your own [configuration](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#config).

You still can commit with `git commit`, however the recommended way to do it is by using **cli-prompt** for commits.

Implemented with [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)

# CLI prompt for commits

You still can commit with git commit, however the recommended way to do it is by using cli-prompt for commits - commitizen-cli. Run `yarn commit` to open 
a prompt with a step-by-step wizard with hints to properly fill in the commit data.

Following conventional commit format will allow us to automatically generate changelog from commit history, that would have chapters (features, bugfixes, etc.) and would look like [this](https://github.com/angular/material2/releases)

# Recommended version bump
Run `yarn recommended:bump` to find out what is the reccomended version for bump.

Implemented with [recommended bump](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-recommended-bump)

# Changelog generation
Run `yarn changelog` to generate a changelog (will overwrite any previous changelog if exists). Generates a changelog based on commits since the last semver tag that match the pattern of a "Feature", "Fix", "Performance Improvement" or "Breaking Changes". Conventional commits are a necessary prerequisite, enabling automatic changelog generation from commit history.

    ```	
    yarn version --major 
    yarn version --minor
    yarn version --patch
    ```
3. Generate changelog with `yarn changelog`
4. Commit `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` files
5. Push including tags with `git push --follow-tags`
6. Manually create a release draft in Github and copypaste changelogâ€™s release markdown to it
